{{California law}}

'''Cannabis in California''' is illegal under US [[federal law]], yet legally sanctioned for [[Medical cannabis|medical use]] since 1996, and for [[Recreational drug use|recreational use]] since late 2016. The state of [[California]] has been at the forefront of efforts to liberalize [[legal history of cannabis in the United States|cannabis laws in the United States]], beginning in 1972 with the nation's first ballot initiative attempting to legalize cannabis ([[California Proposition 19 (1972)|Proposition 19]]). Although it was unsuccessful, California would later become the first state to [[Medical cannabis in the United States|legalize medical cannabis]] through the [[Compassionate Use Act of 1996]] (Proposition 215), which passed with 56% voter approval.{{r|BBC}}  In November 2016, California voters approved the [[2016 California Proposition 64|Adult Use of Marijuana Act]] (Proposition 64) with 57% of the vote, which [[Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|legalized the recreational use of cannabis]]. 

As a result of recreational legalization, local governments (city and county) may not prohibit adults from growing, using, or transporting marijuana for personal use. Commercial activities can be regulated or prohibited by local governments although deliveries cannot be prohibited.{{r|LAT 2019-04-05}}{{r|VCS 2019/06/02}} Following recreational legalization, existing growers and suppliers of medical cannabis were required to register, comply with regulations, and apply for permits. Over half of the nonprofit [[Cannabis dispensaries in the United States|dispensaries legally providing medical marijuana]] closed. Local agencies have been slow to approve retail stores selling cannabis for recreational purposes with most cities and counties banning retail with a wait and see approach. Many existing growers have been slow to apply for permits as it has been estimated that 60 percent or more of all cannabis consumed in the United States comes from northern California. The export of marijuana to other states remains illegal since the [[U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration]] considers it a [[Schedule I drug]].

Reducing illegal activity is considered essential for the success of legal operations who pay the considerable taxes assessed by state and local authorities. Many people do not have nearby retail stores selling cannabis and continue to buy from unlicensed sellers. Illegal growing continues in remote rural areas. Raids and confiscation by law enforcement of illegal retail and grow operations have continued and in some cases stepped up after legalization.

California's main regulatory agencies were initially the [[Bureau of Cannabis Control]] (BCC), [[California Department of Food and Agriculture|Department of Food and Agriculture]], and [[California Department of Public Health|Department of Public Health]].{{r|KSBY 2017-11-22}}{{r|Toast}} Their responsibilities were merged under the Department of Cannabis Control in 2021.<ref>[https://cannabis.ca.gov/about-us/consolidation/ State cannabis consolidation]</ref>

== History ==
=== Industrial hemp ===
[[Cannabis]] was cultivated for fiber and rope as early as 1795 in California, when cultivation began at [[Mission San José (California)|Mission San Jose]] under the governorship of [[Diego de Borica]]. Cannabis was grown in several regions of Southern California, with two-thirds of it being grown on the missions.<ref name="ClarkeMerlin2013">{{cite book|author1=Robert Clarke|author2=Mark Merlin|title=Cannabis: Evolution and Ethnobotany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=poenY6QMq8UC&pg=PA181|date=1 September 2013|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95457-1|pages=181–}}</ref> California produced 13,000 pounds of hemp in 1807, and 220,000 pounds in 1810.<ref name="Incorporated2008">{{cite book|author=Facts On File, Incorporated|title=Marijuana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knyWvsS9-BIC&pg=PA46|year=2008|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1824-6|pages=46–}}</ref> However, in 1810 Mexico began to rebel against the Spanish crown, and the subsidies for growing hemp were cut, leading to a near-disappearance of the crop. A few missions continued to grow it for local use, and the [[Russian colonization of the Americas|Russian colonists]] grew hemp at [[Fort Ross]] until the station was abandoned in 1841.<ref name="ClarkeMerlin2013"/>

=== Psychoactive cannabis ===
Among the early cultivators of cannabis for recreational use in California were Arabs, Armenians, and Turks who grew cannabis as early as 1895 to make [[hashish]] for local consumption.<ref name="Duvall2014">{{cite book|author=Chris Duvall|title=Cannabis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVU8BQAAQBAJ&pg=PT99|date=15 November 2014|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-78023-386-4|pages=99–}}</ref> Unlike in other states where fears of black or Hispanic use of cannabis drove new restrictions, California was an exception for its focus on South Asian immigrants. A California delegate to the Hague Convention wrote in 1911: ''Within the last year we in California have been getting a large influx of Hindoos and they have in turn started quite a demand for cannabis indica; they are a very undesirable lot and the habit is growing in California very fast.''<ref name="Booth2015">{{cite book|author=Martin Booth|title=Cannabis: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecITBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA163|date=16 June 2015|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-250-08219-0|pages=163–}}</ref>

In 1914, one of the first cannabis drug raids in the nation occurred in the Mexican-American neighborhood of [[Sonoratown]] in Los Angeles, where police raided two "dream gardens" and confiscated a wagonload of cannabis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scpr.org/programs/offramp/2014/09/19/39399/the-nation-s-first-marijuana-raid-likely-happened/|title=The nation's first marijuana raid likely happened in LA|date=September 19, 2014|website=Southern California Public Radio}}</ref> In 1925, possession, which had previously been treated the same as distribution, became punishable by up to 6 years in prison, and black market sale, which had initially been a misdemeanor punishable by a $100–$400 fine and/or 50–180 days in jail for first offenders, became punishable by 6 months–6 years.<ref name="gieringer"/> In 1927, the laws designed to target opium usage were finally extended to Indian hemp.<ref name="gieringer"/> In 1929, second offenses for possession became punishable by sentences of 6 months–10 years.<ref name="gieringer"/> In 1937, cannabis cultivation became a separate offense.<ref name="gieringer"/>

By 1932, 60% of narcotics arrests in Los Angeles involved cannabis, which was considered "much less serious than the morphine cases."<ref>{{cite book|title=Survey of Drug Addiction in California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQF4YCdtz7AC|year=1932|publisher=California state printing office, H.

=== Popularization ===
In the 1950s and 1960s, the beatnik and later hippie cultures experimented with cannabis, driving increased interest in the drug. In 1964, the first cannabis legalization group was formed in the U.S. when Lowell Eggemeier of San Francisco was arrested, and his attorney established LEMAR (LEgalize MARijuana) shortly afterwards.<ref name="Rosenthal2009">{{cite book|author=Ed Rosenthal|title=Marijuana Grower's Handbook: Your Complete Guide for Medical and Personal Marijuana Cultivation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySRFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT20|date=1 July 2009|publisher=Quick Trading Company|isbn=978-0-932551-50-4|pages=20–}}</ref> By the mid-1960s, the ''Saturday Evening Post'' was publishing articles estimating that half the college population of California had tried cannabis.

=== Illicit cultivation ===
In the 1960s–1970s, people in California had developed the ''[[sinsemilla]]'' ("without seeds") method of producing cannabis, uprooting the male plants before they could pollinate the females, resulting a seedless and more potent cannabis. Around 1975, this technique arrived in Humboldt County, which was to become one of the nation's most famous centers of cannabis production. California growers received an unintentional advantage from the US government, which in the 1970s began spraying cannabis fields in Mexico with the herbicide [[paraquat]]. Fears of contamination led to a drop in demand for cheaper Mexican cannabis, and a corresponding increase in demand for California-grown cannabis. By 1979, 35% of cannabis consumed in California was grown in-state. By 2010, 79% of cannabis nationwide came from California.<ref name="Brady2013">{{cite book|author=Emily Brady|title=Humboldt: Life on America's Marijuana Frontier|url=https://archive.org/details/humboldtlifeonam0000brad|url-access=registration|date=18 June 2013|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=978-1-4555-0677-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/humboldtlifeonam0000brad/page/55 55]–}}</ref>

=== Medical cannabis legalization ===
==== Early reform efforts (pre-1996) ====
The movement to legalize medical cannabis in the U.S. sprang out of [[San Francisco]] in the early 1990s, with efforts soon spreading statewide and eventually across the nation.  Proposition P was approved by 79% of San Francisco voters in November 1991, calling on state lawmakers to pass legislation allowing the medical use of cannabis.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boire|first1=Richard Glen|last2=Feeney|first2=Kevin|title=Medical Marijuana Law|date=January 26, 2007|publisher=Ronin Publishing|isbn=9781579510343|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1Tw_UFU2XEC}}</ref>  The city board of supervisors additionally passed a resolution in August 1992 urging the police commission and district attorney to "make lowest priority the arrest or prosecution of those involved in the possession or cultivation of [cannabis] for medicinal purposes" and to "allow a letter from a treating physician to be used as [[Prima facie|prima facia]] evidence that marijuana can alleviate the pain and suffering of that patient's medical condition".<ref>{{cite web|title=Proposition P|url=http://www.marijuanalibrary.org/Proposition_P_Nov_1991.html|website=marijuanalibrary.org|access-date=April 30, 2017}}</ref>  The resolution enabled the open sale of cannabis to AIDS patients and others within the city, most notably through the [[San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club]] which was operated by medical cannabis activist [[Dennis Peron]] (who spearheaded Proposition P and later the statewide Proposition 215).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Fred|title=The Cannabis Buyers Club: How Medical Marijuana Began in California|url=https://www.marijuana.com/news/2014/08/the-cannabis-buyers-club-how-medical-marijuana-began-in-california/|access-date=May 4, 2017|work=marijuana.com|date=August 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120221138/https://www.marijuana.com/news/2014/08/the-cannabis-buyers-club-how-medical-marijuana-began-in-california/|archive-date=November 20, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Similar clubs appeared outside San Francisco in the ensuing years as other cities passed legislation to support the medical use of cannabis.

==== Senate Bill 420 (2003) ====
{{Main|California Senate Bill 420}}
[[File:Medical-cannabis-card-california.jpg|thumb|right|Medical cannabis card in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]]]]

Vague wording became a major criticism of Proposition 215, though the law has since been clarified through state Supreme Court rulings and the passage of subsequent laws. The first such legislative solution came in January 2003 with the passage of Senate Bill 420 (colloquially known as the Medical Marijuana Program Act).  Senate Bill 420 established an [[Medical cannabis card|identification card system for medical cannabis patients]], and allowed the formation of non-profit collectives for provision of cannabis to patients.

In 2006 [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] filed a lawsuit over its required participation in the state ID card program,<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Jeff|title=County pursues medicinal marijuana case|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-county-pursues-medicinal-marijuana-case-2008oct27-story.html|access-date=March 7, 2018|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=October 27, 2008}}</ref> but the challenge was later struck down and the city was forced to comply.<ref name="Lee" /> In January 2010 the California Supreme Court ruled in ''[[California Senate Bill 420#People v. Kelly|People v. Kelly]]'' that SB 420 did not limit the quantity of cannabis that a patient can possess.  All possession limits were therefore lifted.

==== Implementation and criticism ====
California was the first state to establish a medical cannabis program, enacted by Proposition 215 in 1996 and Senate Bill 420 in 2003. Proposition 215, also known as the Compassionate Use Act, allows people the right to obtain and use cannabis for any illness if they obtain a recommendation from a doctor. The [[Supreme Court of California]] has ruled there are no specified limits as to what a patient may possess in their private residence if the cannabis is strictly for the patient's own use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.canorml.org/news/supremekelly.html|title=Ca Supreme Court Strikes Down Medical Marijuana Possession, Cultivation Limits|website=www.canorml.org|date=January 21, 2010|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref> Medical cannabis identification cards are issued through the [[California Department of Public Health]]'s Medical Marijuana Program (MMP). The program began in three counties in May 2005, and expanded statewide in August of the same year. 37,236 cards have been issued throughout 55 counties as of December 2009. However, cannabis dispensaries within the state accept recommendations, with an embossed license, from a doctor who has given the patient an examination and believes cannabis would be beneficial for their ailment.

==== Conflict with federal law ====
Although Proposition 215 legalized medical cannabis in California, at the federal level it remained a [[Schedule I drugs|Schedule I]] prohibited drug.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/8/20/17938372/marijuana-legalization-federal-prohibition-drug-scheduling-system|title=Marijuana is illegal under federal law even in states that legalize it|last=Lopez|first=German|date=2018-08-20|work=Vox|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>  Seeking to enforce this prohibition, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] conducted numerous raids and prosecutions of medical cannabis providers throughout the state in subsequent years. Who grows marijuana and where it comes from were lightly regulated. Federal authorities claimed that these medical marijuana businesses were fronts for the black market. Also rather than growing medical marijuana in small batches for patients, they claimed the cannabis was coming from Mexico or large hidden grows in California.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/164981433/legalizing-and-regulating-pot-a-growth-industry|title=Legalizing And Regulating Pot: A Growth Industry|last=Dokoupil|first=Tony|date=November 13, 2012|work=NPR News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14|quote=California doesn't have tight regulations on who grows marijuana, where it comes from. So the feds move in, and what they claim is that these med marijuana businesses are fronts for what are in fact just old-school black market drug dealers. And they're not growing medical marijuana in small batches for patients. They're growing it in Mexico, or they're growing it in the hills, and they're just bringing it in, and it suddenly, magically becomes legal once it gets in the store. But in fact, it's based on illegality.}}</ref> Some state and local officials strongly supported these enforcement efforts, in particular Attorney General [[Dan Lungren]] who was a vocal opponent of Proposition 215 leading up to its passage.<ref name="Lee" />  Other officials, such as San Francisco District Attorney [[Terence Hallinan]], condemned the actions as a gross intrusion into the state's affairs.<ref name="Lee" />  The raids and prosecutions increased in frequency throughout the Bush and Obama years,<ref name="WTC">{{citation|title=What's the Cost? {{!}} The Federal War on Patients|url=https://american-safe-access.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/WhatsTheCost.pdf|access-date=April 29, 2017|publisher=Americans for Safe Access|date=June 2013}}</ref> until finally in December 2014 the [[Rohrabacher–Farr amendment]] was enacted at the federal level.

One of the raids that occurred was at the [[Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana]] in Santa Cruz in September 2002. WAMM was a non-profit collective set up to provide cannabis to seriously ill patients, and was working closely with local authorities to follow all applicable state and local laws.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berry|first1=Denis|title=City leaders stand behind Medical Marijuana at City Hall|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2002/09/city-leaders-stand-behind-medical-marijuana-city-hall|access-date=February 24, 2018|work=Drug Policy Alliance|date=September 12, 2002|archive-date=February 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224232634/http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2002/09/city-leaders-stand-behind-medical-marijuana-city-hall|url-status=dead}}</ref> On the morning of September 5, DEA agents equipped with paramilitary gear and semiautomatic weapons stormed the premises, destroyed all the cannabis plants, and arrested the property owners Mike and Valerie Corral.<ref name="Lee" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Fred|title=The Raid on WAMM|url=http://www.beyondthc.com/the-raid-on-wamm/|access-date=March 6, 2018|work=O'Shaughnessy's|date=September 2002}}</ref> This prompted an angry response from nearby medical cannabis patients{{snd}}some in wheelchairs{{snd}}who gathered at the site to block federal agents from leaving, until finally after three hours later the Corrals were released.<ref name="Lee" /> The raid triggered a strong backlash from Santa Cruz city officials as well, who sanctioned an event two weeks later where cannabis was handed out to patients on the steps of city hall,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Leduff|first1=Charlie|last2=Liptak|first2=Adam|title=Defiant California City Hands Out Marijuana|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/18/us/defiant-california-city-hands-out-marijuana.html|access-date=February 24, 2018|work=The New York Times|date=September 18, 2002}}</ref> attracting widespread media attention.<ref name="Heddleston" />  The DEA was "appalled" by the event,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gaura|first1=Maria Alicia|last2=Stannard|first2=Matthew B.|title=Santa Cruz officials to defy feds, hand out medical pot at City Hall|url=https://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Santa-Cruz-officials-to-defy-feds-hand-out-2771085.php|access-date=February 24, 2018|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=September 13, 2002}}</ref> but took no further action.

Further pushback against federal enforcement efforts occurred in June 2003 following the jury trial conviction of [[Ed Rosenthal]], who had been raided by the DEA in 2002 for growing more than 100 cannabis plants in an [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] warehouse.<ref name="rosenthal">{{cite news|last1=Baily|first1=Eric|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Marcelo|title=The 'Guru of Ganja' Gets a Day in Jail|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-jun-05-me-guru5-story.html|access-date=February 28, 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 5, 2003}}</ref>  Because cannabis remained a prohibited substance under federal law, jurors could not be informed that Rosenthal had been deputized by the city of Oakland to grow the cannabis, or even that the cannabis was being used for medical purposes only.<ref name="Lee">{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Martin A.|title=Smoke Signals: A Social History of Marijuana – Medical, Recreational, and Scientific|date=August 2012|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=978-1439102602}}</ref>  Rosenthal was easily convicted as a result; however, immediately following the trial, when jurors found out the true circumstances of the case, they publicly renounced the verdict they had just handed down and demanded a retrial.<ref name="Lee" />  Judge [[Charles R. Breyer|Charles Breyer]], in part influenced by the extraordinary action of the jurors, sentenced Rosenthal to just one day in jail, of which he had already served.<ref name="rosenthal" />

In July 2007, a new tactic was adopted by the DEA of threatening landlords renting to medical cannabis providers.<ref>{{citation|last1=Eddy|first1=Mark|title=Medical Marijuana: Review and Analysis of Federal and State Policies|url=https://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/medicalmarjiuanastatepolicies040210.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=April 2, 2010}}</ref>  Letters were sent to a number of property owners in the Los Angeles area, informing them that they faced up to 20 years in prison for violating the "crack house statute" of the Controlled Substances Act, in addition to seizure of their properties.  This tactic subsequently spread to other areas of California, while DEA raids continued to increase as well in the following years.  In October 2011 an extensive and coordinated crackdown on California's cannabis dispensaries was announced by the chief prosecutors of the state's four federal districts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2011-oct-07-la-me-obama-medical-marijuana-20111008-story.html|title=Federal crackdown on medical pot sales reflects a shift in policy|last=Hoeffel|first=John|date=October 7, 2011|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

Three major court cases originated in California that attempted to challenge the federal government's ability to enforce federal law in states that have legalized medical cannabis.  ''[[Conant v. McCaffrey]]'' was brought forth in response to various threats made by the federal government against doctors who recommend cannabis to patients.  Decided in 2000, it upheld the right of physicians to recommend but not prescribe cannabis.<ref name="mpp">{{citation|title=State-By-State Medical Marijuana Laws|url=https://www.mpp.org/assets/pdf/issues/medical-marijuana/State-by-State-Laws-Report-2015.pdf|publisher=Marijuana Policy Project|date=December 2016}}</ref>  In ''[[United States v.

Raich]]'' (decided in 2005), the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act was challenged based on the idea that cannabis grown and consumed in California does not qualify as [[interstate commerce]]{{snd}}but this argument was also found to be without merit.<ref name="mpp" />

=== Recreational cannabis legalization ===

{{main|California Proposition 19 (1972)}}
In 1972, California became the first state to vote on a ballot measure seeking to legalize cannabis.

==== Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act (2009) ====
{{main|Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act}}
In February 2009, [[Tom Ammiano]] introduced the Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act, which would remove penalties under state law for the cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for persons the age of 21 or older. When the Assembly Public Safety Committee approved the bill on a 4 to 3 vote in January 2010, this marked the first time in United States history that a bill legalizing marijuana passed a legislative committee. While the legislation failed to reach the Assembly floor, Ammiano stated his plans to reintroduce the bill later in the year, depending on the success of [[California Proposition 19 (2010)|Proposition 19]], the Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act.<ref name="banks1">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-mar-29-la-me-banks30-2010mar30-story.html|title=Pot breaks the age barrier|last=Banks|first=Sandy|date=March 29, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=March 31, 2010}}</ref> According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', California tax collectors estimated the bill would have raised about $1.3 billion a year in revenue.

Critics such as John Lovell, lobbyist for the California Peace Officers' Association, argued that too many people already struggle with alcohol and drug abuse, and legalizing another mind-altering substance would lead to a surge of use, making problems worse.<ref name="Time">{{cite magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1884956,00.html|title=Can Marijuana Help Rescue California's Economy?|last=Stateman|first=Alison|date=March 13, 2009|magazine=Time|access-date=May 24, 2021}}</ref> Apart from helping the state's budget by enforcing a tax on the sale of cannabis, proponents of the bill argued that legalization would reduce the amount of criminal activity associated with the drug.

==== Proposition 19 (2010) ====
{{main|California Proposition 19 (2010)}}
In November 2010, California voters rejected Proposition 19 (by a vote of 53.5% to 46.5%), an initiative that would have legalized the use, possession, and cultivation of cannabis for adults age 21 and over, and regulated its sale similar to alcohol.<ref>{{cite news|title=California Proposition 19, the Marijuana Legalization Initiative (2010)|url=https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_19,_the_Marijuana_Legalization_Initiative_(2010)|website=Ballotpedia|access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref>  The initiative faced stiff opposition from numerous police organizations in the state, while many growers in the [[Emerald Triangle]] were strongly opposed due to fears that corporate megafarms would put them out of business.<ref name="Lee" />  The initiative was also undercut by the passage of [[#Senate Bill 1449 (2010)|Senate Bill 1449]] a month before the election.<ref name="Lee" />  Proposition 19 was spearheaded by [[Richard Lee (activist)|Richard Lee]], founder of [[Oaksterdam University]].<ref name="Lee" />

In September 2022, Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law a number of cannabis-related reforms, including bills to protect cannabis users from healthcare discrimination,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jaeger |first1=Kyle |title=California Governor Signs Bill Protecting Medical Cannabis Patients From Healthcare Discrimination |url=https://www.marijuanamoment.net/california-governor-signs-bill-protecting-medical-cannabis-patients-from-healthcare-discrimination/ |access-date=September 28, 2022 |work=Marijuana Moment |date=September 5, 2022}}</ref> require child welfare social workers to treat parental cannabis use the same as alcohol,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jaeger |first1=Kyle |title=California Governor Signs Child Welfare Bill Treating Parental Marijuana Use Just Like Alcohol |url=https://www.marijuanamoment.net/california-governor-signs-child-welfare-bill-treating-parental-marijuana-use-just-like-alcohol/ |access-date=September 28, 2022 |work=Marijuana Moment |date=September 7, 2022}}</ref> prevent employees from being fired for cannabis use outside of work hours (with exceptions for federal employees or workers in safety-sensitive positions),<ref name="ten">{{cite news |last1=Jaeger |first1=Kyle |title=California Governor Signs 10 Marijuana Bills, Including Interstate Commerce, Employment Protections And Record Sealing |url=https://www.marijuanamoment.net/california-governor-signs-10-marijuana-bills-including-interstate-commerce-employment-protections-and-record-sealing/ |access-date=September 28, 2022 |work=Marijuana Moment |date=September 18, 2022}}</ref> allow veterinarians to recommend medical cannabis for pets,<ref name="ten" /> facilitate the sealing of records for certain cannabis offenses,<ref name="ten" /> and allow interstate commerce for cannabis to and from California (provided that the federal government has first indicated that it will allow such activity).<ref name="ten" />

====Pesticide contamination====
In June 2024, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' tested legally-sold cannabis products in California and uncovered large amounts of pesticides in many  cannabis products.   Twenty-five of 42 products contained pesticides exceeding the levels permitted by law.  The investigation alleges that many testing laboratories fraudulently certified products as satisfying pesticide regulations, when in fact they did not meet the regulations. Owners of some private testing laboratories stated that they were forced out of business because they refused to falsify test results.  The Department of Cannabis Control, which is responsible for regulating cannabis in California, refused to release the results of its own internal testing of cannabis products.  In September 2024, a lawsuit was filed by a former employee of the Department of Cannabis Control, alleging that the head of the department had ignored fraudulent testing, and that the department fired the former employee  when the employee attempted to publicize the fraud.<ref name="tumult">
