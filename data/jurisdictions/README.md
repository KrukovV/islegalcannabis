# Jurisdictions

## ISO 3166-1 coverage
- Target list is ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 with 249 entries (countries + territories).
- Coverage progress is tracked in `data/jurisdictions/catalog.json`.

## Regional levels (ADM)
- There is no fixed global number of regions.
- We model coverage by levels: country -> ADM1 -> ADM2 as needed.
- Examples:
  - Country-level: `DE`
  - ADM1-level: `US-CA`
  - (Future) ADM2-level: `US-CA-LA`
